                      <p class="card-text"> First love never dies they say—unless your first love is already engaged to be married when you meet. Then you have to let it go really fast. Such was the case of Jose Rizal and Segunda Katigbak, a Batangueña, whom Rizal met when he was only a 16-year-old boy.  </p>

                      <p class="card-text"> Leonor “Orang” Valenzuela, Rizal’s second object of affection, is literally the girl-next-door. They met when Rizal was a sophomore medical student at the University of Santo Tomas, during which time he also lived at Doña Concha Leyva’s boarding house in Intramuros, Manila. Orang, who was then 14 years old, was his neighbor.</p>

                      <p class="card-text"> Leanor Rivera and Jose Rizal lived the tragedies of Shakespeare’s poems. They met when Rizal was 18 and Leonor was 13, at the boarding house of Rizal’s uncle in Intramuros, Manila. Leonor was Rizal’s second cousin.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">  Consuelo Ortega Y Rey was the daughter of Don Pablo Ortiga Y Rey, who was Mayor of Manila when Maria dela Torre was the governor. While Rizal was in Madrid, he would hang out at Don Pablo’s house, which became a place where Filipino students would often get together. Through one of these gatherings, Rizal met Consuelo.

                        He showed affection towards Consuelo but was not serious in his pursuit as he was still engaged to Leonor Rivera at the time. Yes, he loved the company of women, but during that brief period, he too  was lonely and yearning for the physical void left by Leonor.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">In many of his diary entries, Rizal wrote about how he was charmed by Japan’s beauty, cleanliness, and peace and order. But if there was one thing that almost kept him in the country where cherry blossoms bloom most beautiful, it was a woman named Seiko Usui, affectionately called O-Sei-San.  </p>

                      <p class="card-text"> In the same year he began and ended his relations with O-Sei-San, our JR, then 27, went to London and met a woman named Gertrude Beckett, the eldest daughter of his landlord. Gertrude showered Rizal with all the love and attention of a girl who is hopelessly in love. She even assisted Rizal as he finished some of his popular sculptures, “Prometheus Bound,” “The Triumph of Death over Life,” and “The Triumph of Science over Death.” He called her Gettie, she called him Pettie. But all documents lead to say one thing: the feelings weren’t mutually shared. </p>

                      <p class="card-text"> Maybe Rizal was repulsed with the idea of having an idle mind. With all the loneliness and anxiety from the turmoil of his country and family, he was even able to fill his resting moments learning new things—like flirting with women. When he arrived in Belgium in 1890, he lived at a boarding house that was run by two sisters whose last name was Jacoby. The sisters had a niece named Suzanne. You probably can guess now what happens with Rizal and his caretaker’s kin. If it’s not a neighbor, it’s a caretaker’s kin. Are we seeing a trend here? Obviously the guy is too busy to explore beyond a one-kilometer radius.</p>

                      <p class="card-text"> Remember that famous time when Antonio Luna and Jose Rizal almost got into a duel because of a girl? The girl in the middle of that madness was Nellie Boustead. Rizal and Nellie met in Biarritz, where Nellie’s wealthy family hosted Rizal’s stay at their residence on the French Riviera. Before Biarritz, Rizal already made friends with the Boustead family a few years back, and even played fencing with Nellie and her sister. </p>

                      <p class="card-text"> Josephine Bracken was the woman who stayed with Rizal until his execution in 1896. She was also, allegedly, the woman whom Rizal married. However, accounts of their marriage have been much-debated over the years.

                        Josephine was the adopted daughter of one George Taufer, whom she lived with in Hongkong for years before she needed to seek help from an ophthalmologist due to George’s blindness. They then sought the help of Jose Rizal, who was already exiled in Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte at the time. Rizal and Josephine fell in love and in a month made the announcement that they wanted to get married. But just like the other Rizal great loves, this one was once again complicated.  </p>
